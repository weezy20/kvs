//!
//! - *command* - A request or the representation of a request made to the database.
//! These are issued on the command line or over the network.
//! They have an in-memory representation, a textual representation, and a machine-readable serialized representation.
//!
//! - *log* - An on-disk sequence of commands, in the order originally received and executed.
//! Our database's on-disk format is almost entirely made up of logs.
//! It will be simple, but also surprisingly efficient.
//!
//! - *log pointer* - A file offset into the log. Sometimes we'll just call this a "file offset".
//!
//! - *log compaction* - As writes are issued to the database they sometimes invalidate old log entries.
//! For example, writing key/value a = 0 then writing a = 1, makes the first log entry for "a" useless.
//! Compaction — in our database at least — is the process of reducing the size of the database by remove stale commands from the log.
//!
//! - *in-memory index (or index)* - A map of keys to log pointers.
//! When a read request is issued, the in-memory index is searched for the appropriate log pointer,
//! and when it is found the value is retrieved from the on-disk log. In our key/value store, like in bitcask,
//! the index for the entire database is stored in memory.
//!
//! - *index file* - The on-disk representation of the in-memory index.
//! Without this the log would need to be completely replayed to restore the state of the in-memory index each time the database is started.
